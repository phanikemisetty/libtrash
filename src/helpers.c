 * That is, it resolves the symlink at 'path' and returns the absolute path of
 * whatever it points to.
 * 
 * else (meaning that either (i) should_follow_final_symlink is zero, (ii) path 
 * doesn't exist or (iii) path exists but is NOT a symlink): 
 *  
 * 1 - isolates the filename in path from the rest of the path which precedes it

 * 2 - run canonicalize_file_name() on the rest of the path;
 * 3 - return the concatenation of the return value of canonicalize_file_name()
 * with the filename in case of success, NULL otherwise.
 *
 * The reason why it is useful and we don't always call canonicalize_file_name() directly instead
 * is because, if the last component (the filename) is a symlink, canon...() resolves it.
 * This makes it useless in the unlink() and rename() wrappers, because those functions
 * act upon the symlinks themselves, not the files they point at. But they still need to
 * resolve any other symlinks in the path, so we can't just use the absolute "unresolved"
 * path. 
 * 
 * Most importantly, canonicalize_file_name() always fails on paths to inexistent 
 * files. This function provides a convenient wrapper around it (which I use in 
 * some non-libtrash code).

/* This function is used by the wrappers of the *at() functions. It "resolves"

 * functions do. More specifically:
 * 
 * - passed a file descriptor to a dir and a *relative* path, it returns the 
 *   absolute path to the file called arg_pathname located under the dir referred 
 *   to by dirfd. 
 * - passed an *absolute* arg_pathname, then it returns a pointer to its own 
 *   argument. 
 * - passed dirfd==AT_FDCWD, then it returns a pointer to its own argument. 
 *
 * (This is how the *at() functions handle their path+dirfd arguments: dirfd 
 * is only taken into account if (i) it is != AT_FDCWD and (ii) the arg_pathname 
 * is relative.) Since we don't always return a malloc()ed buffer (might return
 * a pointer to the arg_pathname arg!), calling code must check if
 * retval != arg_pathname before free()ing that memory.
 * 
 * It returns a pointer to (i) a malloc()ed buffer containing the desired path,
 * (ii) a pointer to its own arg or (iii) NULL in case of error (in which case 
 * errno might also have been set to something meaningful). In case (i), the
 * caller must call free() on the returned pointer.
 *
 * It relies on the /proc filesystem to figure out what the dirfd arg refers to.
