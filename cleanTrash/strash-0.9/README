strash, version 0.9
===================


Description
-----------

strash is a Bourne shell script for use with libtrash by Manuel Arriaga
(http://www.m-arriaga.net/software/libtrash/).

It will enforce age, number or size limits on libtrash trash cans so they
won't eventually fill your storage space.

It is meant to be run by root on a regular basis.


Requirements
------------

strash relies on common UNIX utilities that should already be installed on your
system:

- any Bourne compatible shell (ash, bash, ksh...)
- fileutils (cp, du, mkdir, rm, rmdir)
- findutils (find)
- grep (egrep, grep)
- sed (sed)
- sh-utils (date)
- textutils (cat, cut, sort, wc, tac)


Installation
------------

1) Copy strash to a directory in your $PATH, such as /usr/sbin/.
2) Edit the "Configuration" section of strash it you want to customize it.
3) Copy strash.8 to a directory in your $MANPATH, such as /usr/man/man8/.
4) Add a cron entry to run strash on a regular basis.


Tips
----

If a history file and upper directories don't exist, strash will create them
with root ownership. If you want them to be owned by another user, you'll have
to create them before you run strash, and perhaps you'll want to add them to
your skeleton directory (usually /etc/skel/).

If you want history files to be strictly accurate, run strash before any
application that access the files in trash cans, such as a local search engine,
or exclude trash cans from indexing.

If you want slightly better performance, use a temporary directory in RAM
(use tmpfs for instance).
