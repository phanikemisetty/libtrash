.SH NAME
strash \- strip files from libtrash trash cans

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBstrash\fR LIMIT [OPTION]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBstrash\fR is a Bourne shell script for use with libtrash by Manuel Arriaga
(http://www.m-arriaga.net/software/libtrash/).

It will enforce age, number or size limits on libtrash trash cans so they
won't eventually fill your storage space.

It is meant to be run by root on a regular basis.

.SH LIMIT
In the following parameters, files exactly matching <limit> are excluded and
won't be removed.

.IP "\fB--age\fR <limit>\fB, -A\fR <limit>"
Restrict the age of files to <limit>.

A time unit can be specified, the default being seconds:
  \fBs\fR: seconds
  \fBm\fR: minutes
  \fBh\fR: hours
  \fBd\fR: days
  \fBM\fR: months
  \fBY\fR: years

.IP "\fB--filesize\fR <limit>\fB, -F\fR <limit>"
Restrict the size of files to <limit>. By default, the biggest files are
removed first.

A size unit can be specified, the default being bytes:
  \fBb\fR: bytes
  \fBk\fR: kilobytes
  \fBM\fR: megabytes
  \fBG\fR: gigabytes

.IP "\fB--number\fR <limit>\fB, -N\fR <limit>"
Restrict the number of files in trash cans to <limit>.

.IP "\fB--size\fR <limit>\fB, -S\fR <limit>"
Restrict the size of trash cans to <limit>.

A size unit can be specified, the default being bytes.
  \fBb\fR: bytes
  \fBk\fR: kilobytes
  \fBM\fR: megabytes
  \fBG\fR: gigabytes

.SH FILE SORTING OPTIONS

By default, files are removed in the same order in which they were added to the
trash can. \fBstrash\fR uses a history file located in each user's home
directory to achieve that.  This behavior can be changed with the following
options.

.IP "\fB--sort=biggest, -b\fR"
Remove the biggest files first.

.IP "\fB--sort=smallest, -s\fR"
Remove the smallest files first.

.IP "\fB--sort=oldest, -o\fR"
Remove the oldest files first.
By default, the last modification time is used to sort the files.

.IP "\fB--time=atime, --time=access, --time=use, -a\fR"
When removing the oldest files first, use the last access time to sort the
files.

.IP "\fB--time=ctime, --time=status, -c\fR"
When removing the oldest files first, use the last status change time to sort
the files.

.SH GENERAL OPTIONS

.IP "\fB--du, -d\fR"
Use \fBdu\fR to compute the trash can size.

By default, the trash can size is the sum of all file sizes. If you run
\fBdu\fR on a trash directory, it may report a size bigger than the limit you
specified, because it rounds sizes up and adds directory sizes.
If you want \fBdu\fR to report that the limit is not exceeded, use this option.
This may significantly slow down \fBstrash\fR.

.IP "\fB--print, -p\fR"
Print the name of the files that should be removed. Do not remove them.

.IP "\fB--si, -H\fR"
Use the official SI units, with powers of 1000 instead of 1024.

.IP "\fB--user\fR <user>\fB, -u\fR <user>"
Strip <user>'s trash can.

This option can be specified more than once.
If it is not specified, \fBstrash\fR strips all trash cans.

.SH VERBOSITY OPTIONS

.IP "\fB--quiet, -q\fR"
Do not output anything (except the name of the files that should be removed if
\fB--print\fR is specified).

.IP "\fB--verbose, -v\fR"
Be verbose.

.SH GNU STANDARD OPTIONS

.IP "\fB--help, -h\fR"
Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.

.IP "\fB--version, -V\fR"
Print version information on standard output, then exit successfully.

.IP "\fB--\fR"
Terminate option list.

.SH EXAMPLES
To remove files deleted over one month ago:
.RS
.B strash --age 1M
.RE

To remove all zero files:
.RS
.B strash --filesize 1 --sort=smallest
.RE

To restrict the number of files in trash cans to 10000, removing files with
oldest access time first:
.RS
.B strash --number 10000 --sort=oldest --time=atime
.RE

To restrict john's trash can size to 64,000,000 bytes:
.RS
.B strash --size 64M --si --user john
.RE

To restrict trash can sizes to 64MB, as shown by \fBdu\fR:
.RS
.B strash --size 64M --du

.SH FILES
